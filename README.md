# Thonk Bot

### About
The source code for a Discord bot built on Python and run on Docker, that I am creating to learn more about the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) rewrite, ~~as well as an excuse to do something when I'm bored.~~

I'm mainly using the [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) library, and experimenting with [PyNaCl](https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/) for voice support. Hopefully I can structure my code using cogs, makes the project way more neater overall.


As of right now, **I do *not* plan on making my bot for public use**, so I will not be providing a link to invite the bot to servers. However, this may change later on.


If you would like to see more projects from me, make sure to check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/TechnoShip123)!

The bot's documentation can be found [here](https://thonkbot.zetasj.com).

### For code use/modification
You will need to provide a `key.txt` file containing the bot key that you generate from your application in the Discord Developer page. This bot will also contain code for slash-commands so you will need to make sure your bot app has access to them.


If you plan on using part of or even all of this code for your own bots, you are welcome to do so and modify it as well. However I ask that you credit me and keep the `LICENSE` file intact to comply with the [GNU GPL v3 license](https://github.com/TechnoShip123/Thonk-Bot/blob/master/LICENSE).
It may seem annoying, but it helps make sure that the work I put into it does not go to waste. Thank you for understanding!
